This repository is a fork of the awesome GRBL firmware (https://github.com/gnea/grbl), adapted for the Bungard CCD/2 PCB mill we have at the Technistub Fablab/Makerspace in Mulhouse.
The main goal of this project was to modernize this machine and teach it new tricks (GCode !), without heavy hardware modifications.
